  "about_me": [
    "Hi visitor, my name is Lahoucine Aboulhassan. My friends call me Hassan for short, I'm 25 years old from Morocco. Anyway, you might already know that since it's everywhere in my portfolio. I studied at the IBN ZOHR University in Agadir city. After 4 years of education, I got my certificate in Computer Science.",
    "In my free time, I like to watch movies, tv shows, anime, and I like to read manga, novels, and articles that spark my interest. For example, scientific articles about AI, astronomy, or quantum physics. about new discoveries and mysterious things...\nI also love to practice photography and travel to new places. When I see something beautiful, I make sure to capture that image. As you can see on my webpage, there are plenty of images.\nDespite being told Iâ€™m not that good, I keep working on it because I know skills take time. My career focus involves coding. After many tutorials and online courses, I chose to focus on the front end.\nI learned the basics of HTML, CSS, ES6 and I'm learning the Vue js and React js frameworks. Please check out my projects using these technologies on my GitHub repos.",
    "I will greatly appreciate it if you can provide some feedback or available internships in web development. Enjoy looking through my portfolio and Thank you for visiting my website :)"

        "So far, my work experience has been at the nursery garden of tomatoes. I started working there my first year in high school, 2011.\nI learned that gardening is complex and labor-intensive. It requires a lot of care and physical strength to make every operation successful.\nWhen it comes to having successful teamwork, I made sure I showed respect, support, commitment, and good communication.\nSo working in a team was a good way to develop strong communication skills, time management, and problem-solving. For example, I had to fix complex tasks into simple steps.",
        "I bit more about my work is that I worked on the transplanting group mainly and I trail with other groups often. I  was responsible for organizing tomato types and bringing the type of tomato we were going to work on. Then, I do the paving of the plaques which come from the women workers.\nI also make sure that the different types of tomatoes don't mix up during the operation, while my teammates are responsible for loading the plaques, transporting them, and helping me organize them. At the end of the day, I have to calculate how much we have been able to produce in each type of tomato.",
        "Teamwork is an important skill because many jobs will require it. After having this job, I invested some of my time planting my own lettuce, potatoes, and flowers."
